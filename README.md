# TrumpBot
The classiest, richest, Trumpiest Markov bot on the internet.

TrumpBot automatically periodically retrieves tweets from @realDonaldTrump's twitter feed, does some simple cleaning on the retrieved text, and adds them to a growing encyclopedia of text that includes previous tweets, plus some full-text transcriptions of Trump speeches. This encyclopidia is then fed to a [Markov chain text generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain#Markov_text_generators), which periodically produces and posts tweets in the style of Trump.
